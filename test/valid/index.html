    <h1>This is a Sass compilation demo</h1>

    <p>The idea is to compile sass in a stream, like Gulp does, but instead of outputting build artifacts (.css-files) on disk, they are kept in the HTTP-stream of the server.</p>
    <p>Further more the file watchers set up for live reloading are inferred from the requests from the browser and from the dependency graph of the requested files, allowing you a zero configuration setup where the server just does the right thing based on what the browser reqests.</p>
